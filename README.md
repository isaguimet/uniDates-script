# University Dates Script

## What was the problem I wanted to solve with this script?

Every semester to get organized, I create a OneNote notebook for each of my classes and I create 'Lecture' sections for all of these classes.
For each class, I divide my lecture notes into the weeks of a semester. The picture below describes how it looks at the end of the semester:

Before, I used to create these dates manually until I decided I no longer wanted to spend time creating all the dates and weeks of a semester every semester. So, I decided to automate it with a simple python script.

## The result

By using one essential python module, datetime, I was able to solve this problem. The script outputs a list of the 14 weeks of the semester (including reading week) with the dates of each week. Below is a picture of the desired result:
