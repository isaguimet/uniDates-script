# University Dates Script

## What was the problem I wanted to solve with this script?

Every semester to get organized, I create a OneNote notebook for each of my classes and I create 'Lecture' sections for all of these classes.
For each class, I divide my lecture notes into the weeks of a semester. The picture below describes how it looks at the end of the semester:

Before I used to create these dates manually until I decided I no longer wanted to spend time doing this each semester. So, I decided to automate it with 
a simple python script.
